**Code-first documentation and delivery process toolkit.** Extract patterns from TypeScript and Gherkin sources, generate living documentation and architecture diagrams, and enforce delivery workflow via FSM.

## Why This Exists

Traditional documentation fails because it exists outside the code. When AI agents receive unstructured markdown, they hallucinate APIs, ignore architectural constraints, and consume excessive token budgets.

This package inverts the paradigm: **the Git repository is the event store**, and all generated documentation is a derived projection of annotated source code.

## Quick Start

  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @libar-dev/delivery-process
    ```

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Pattern Extraction** | TypeScript JSDoc and Gherkin tag scanning with shape extraction |
| **MasterDataset** | Single read model with O(1) pre-computed views |
| **Codec Rendering** | 20 codecs generating markdown with progressive disclosure |
| **FSM Workflow** | Finite state machine enforcement via pre-commit hooks |
| **Data API CLI** | Query delivery state directly — 5-10x less context than raw file reads |
| **Dual-Source Architecture** | TypeScript owns implementation tags, Gherkin owns planning tags |
